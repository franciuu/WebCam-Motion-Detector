# Motion Detection Program
This repository contains a simple motion detection program written in Python using OpenCV and Pandas. The program captures video from your webcam and detects motion based on differences in video frames. When motion is detected, it draws a rectangle around the moving object and logs the start and end times of the motion events. After the webcam is turned off, a graph is generated using Bokeh to visualize the motion times, providing a clear view of when motion events occurred. When hovering over the graph, the exact start and end times of each motion event are displayed.

## Note
This is a simplistic program intended for educational purposes. It was developed as part of Ardit Sulce's course on Udemy. It demonstrates basic motion detection techniques and is not meant for advanced or production-level use.
